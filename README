=== What is MiniCache? ===
MiniCache is a small, lightweight PHP5 cache system made for novice to intermediate developers, or skilled developers that don't demand the full feature set of memcached.


=== Why use MiniCache? ===
* You are dynamically generating HTML strings, but it can be slow and hinder performance. You can use MiniCache to store the generated HTML string.
* You want to save the state of a PHP object. MiniCache can save the entire object for later reuse.
* You want to parse data from multiple sources into a PHP array. MiniCache can act as a central data storage location, keeping your memory footprint lower.


====== Sample Code ======
$mc= MiniCache::getInstance();
$mc->set('myfirstkey', 'Hello world!');
echo $mc->get('myfirstkey'); // Hello world!
